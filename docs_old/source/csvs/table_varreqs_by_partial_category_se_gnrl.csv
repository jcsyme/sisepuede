Input,Fraction Eating Red Meat,"Gives a scalar *a* for demand for red meat in the country. Used to represent adoption of vegetarianism. Decreases in this scalar lead to increases in crop consumption, with the per-capita demand for crops increasng by the scalar **dietary_exchange** for 100(1  - *a*)% of the population (see land use sector).
