Input,Fraction of Nitrogen Used in Fertilizer," | This scalar represents the fraction of total volatile solids (manure) available for fertilizer. Some categories, like ``deep_bedding`` are often combined with others. To avoid mutli-stage management, entries for these categories should specify a fraction of manure that will eventually end up used in fertilizer.
