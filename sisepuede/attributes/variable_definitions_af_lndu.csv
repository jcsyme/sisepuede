 | Per Volume 4, Chapter 6, Section 6.2.3.1 (pg 6-15 in 2006 IPCC GNGHGI), grasslands are not included because they are not managed--pastures represent the managed grassland state: _""Equation 2.26 (Chapter 2) is used to estimate C stock change in managed grassland on organic soils (e.g., peat- derived, Histosols). The methodology is to stratify managed organic soils by climate region and assign a climate-specific annual emission rate. Land areas are multiplied by the emission factor and then summed to derive annual C emissions. Natural grasslands that may be used for seasonal grazing but have not been artificially drained should not be included in this category.""_"

Input,Land Use Yield Reallocation Factor,"The land use yield reallocation factor :math:`\eta \in [0, 1]` is used to represent land use responsiveness to changes in demands. 
 | 
 | If :math:`\eta = 1`, then **land use will be reallocated**, diverging from the specified transition matrix. If demands exceed carrying capacity to meet all livestock and crop demands, then the transitions into grassland and cropland are increased to meet demands. If the carrying capacity exceeds demand, then transitions to grassland and croplands are reduced (which also increases forested land). 
 | 
 | If :math:`\eta = 0`, then **land use will remain as specified**, and all remaining demands with be met with net imports. If the demand is less then carrying capacity, then there is an increase in net exports; if demand exceeds carrying capacity, there is an increase in net imports.

Input,Maximum Pasture Dry Matter Yield Factor," | Maximum potential yield of pastures in tonne/ha/month. The number of grazing animals that pasture can support are bounded by the maximum potential yield. The number of AU (animal units) implied by carrying capacity cannot exceed this number.

 | Default maximum value taken from `FarmBrite <https://www.farmbrite.com/post/how-many-cows-can-i-keep-per-acre>`_ under the assumption of technically feasible maximum--excellent pasture with irrigation, or 6,900 lb/acre. Using a conversion of 907.1858189 short tonne per kg, we use 3.45 ston/acre => 3129.791075205 kg/acre. The, using 0.404686 ha/acre, we get 7733.875338422877 kg/ha, or 7.734 tonne/ha/month as a default maximum. This is approximateluy 92.81 when expanded to annual. 
 | 
 | **NOTE:** This number varies significantly by geography, climate, and pasture utilization rate, and users should take care to set it.
